- **`nrc_reviews`** - Human reviewer checklist submissions
- **`nrc_assignment_rules`** - Configurable auto-assignment rules
- **`nrc_evidence_queries`** - Clarification requests to nominees
- **`nrc_verification_summaries`** - Final decision records

### Enhanced Tables
- **`nominations`** - Added `workflow_status`, `rubric_version`, `query_count`, `sla_deadline`
- **`nrc_members`** - Added `nrc_role`, `current_assignments`, `total_reviews`, `is_available`

## Workflow States
